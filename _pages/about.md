## Presentation

Hi! Based in Peru (LatAm), I am a seasoned Tech Lead AI/ML Engineer with a specialization and solid background (math and programming) in advanced artificial intelligence and machine learning solutions. I worked as a contractor with companies and startups across the USA and Europe (full-time).

With over 5 years of experience, I specialize in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Computer Vision, (Deep) Reinforcement Learning, and Natural Language Processing (NLP). For the past 3 years, I have focused on Generative AI (LLMs), addressing complex commercial challenges. My solutions leverage Cloud Computing (AWS, GCP, Azure) and Edge Computing (NVIDIA Jetson Nano, Raspberry Pi).

I have led numerous analytics and software projects across variety of sectors, including Retail, Banking, Telecommunications, Mining, Energy, and Education.

I am proactive, a strong team player, and skilled in leadership, with a commitment to continuous learning and professional growth.
