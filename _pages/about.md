## Presentation

Hi! Based in Peru (LatAm), I am an experienced AI/ML Technical Lead and AI Software Engineer working remotely with companies and startups across the USA and Europe as Contractor.

With over 5 years of hands-on experience, I specialize in building intelligent systems and solving optimization problems using Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Computer Vision, NLP, (Deep) Reinforcement Learning and Bio-Inspired Computing and Genetic Algorithms for industrial applications (supermarket location planning - class schedule optimization - airport gate assignment)

In the last 3 years, my focus has shifted toward Generative AI, where I’ve designed and deployed advanced LLM-powered solutions—including Graph-based Multi-Agent Systems, Agentic/Graph RAG and MCP — to tackle real-world business challenges.

Beyond AI, I bring strong expertise in backend development, building scalable and maintainable systems following software engineering best practices. I’ve led the development of robust AI-powered APIs and architected serverless, microservices, and hexagonal systems fully integrated into production pipelines.

My background also includes Cloud Engineering (AWS, GCP, Azure) and Edge AI (NVIDIA Jetson Nano, Raspberry Pi), along with experience in DevOps and MLOps, ensuring smooth Infrastructure (IaC terraform), CI/CD/CT workflows and reliable AI/ML model deployment.

I’ve successfully led data analytics, data science/engineer and software projects in industries such as Retail, Banking, Telecom, Mining, Energy, Education and Media.

I thrive in dynamic, collaborative environments, always aiming to deliver scalable, impactful tech—backed by clean code, sound architecture, and continuous learning.
